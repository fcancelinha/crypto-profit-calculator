  Crypto Profit App
</h1> 

> Whenever I was searching on the internet for a simple calculator to do some quick math I could never find one. There were mining calculators for sure but not really what I was looking for... So ! I decided to make my own and share with anyone facing the same troubles as I once did. This is my first attempt at creating an app using react and I feel like I still have so much to learn. I regret not using Redux and Typescript as the scope of the project quickly grew beyond my initial expectations as I was adding more and more features.
